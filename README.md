# Muli 

## Webapp developed using React.JS

With this web app users can create music lists sorted by genres, bands and albums. So far, the most important features are:

- Add new music.
- Remove elements (songs, albums, etc).
- Collapsible lists.

## Development work is ongoing to improve functionalities and add new features.

The idea is not just to create music lists, but help musicians to create their best lists. To achieve this goal, users will be able to add additional information about each track -e.g. BPM, key, year released...- and then use this information to make new lists. In addition, a search bar will be implemented and the aside box will be used as a panel.
